### A simple Music Player made using tkinter (for GUI) , Pygame (for playing music) and Python language for backend logic.

Functionalities Available : 
- Add songs to Playlist and select song to play
- Play, Pause, Stop 
- Volume Control
- Awesome theme from tkinter

Shortcomings : 
- pygame doesn't allow playing of .mp3 files, however .ogg files work perfectly
- Certain faults in Logic i.e. future work :p

Learnt from : [Build with Python : tkinter Music Player Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhTjy8cBISEp6lNKUO3iwbB1DKAkRwutl)

This project is really useful to help understand the working of tkinter library for creating fast and easy GUIs. Here's all that I learnt about tkinter!
